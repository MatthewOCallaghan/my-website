		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			I'm a computer science student studying at the University of Southampton who holds a keen interest in web development.
		</p>
		<p>
			In July 2015, I started developing <a href='http://www.kopstop.co.uk'>kopstop.co.uk</a> (featured below) and over the past three years this website has become my online playground for practising web development.  The latest update now includes React, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL.  From my academic studies, I also have experience of programming in Java.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the future, I hope to pursue other areas, including app development and game development.

		<p>
			An ongoing project I first started in July 2015, Kop Stop is an online library of Liverpool Football Club songs and chants. In the last three years, <a href='http://www.kopstop.co.uk'>kopstop.co.uk</a> has seen multiple updates, the latest of which saw me transform it into a database-driven React app, with users now able to filter and search through the numerous sets of lyrics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Named after the famous stand at Liverpool's stadium Anfield, Kop Stop stores over one hundred songs, each of which has a number of associated tags referencing the players, managers and clubs they are inspired by.  The lyrics and tags are stored in a PostgreSQL database and React allows users to seamlessly search and filter through these songs by their tags.
		</p>
		<p>
			In future updates, I plan to include videos on the website of each song and in the long run transform Kop Stop into a more general fan site, with news articles, forums and other similar features.
