            <p>
                I'm a recent Computer Science graduate of the University of Southampton who holds a keen interest in programming, especially web, app and game development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently released my first mobile game, <a href="https://www.experimentalgravity.com" target="_blank">Experimental Gravity</a>, on iOS. Experimental Gravity is a physics-based puzzle game that puts the player in control of gravity. I have completed several projects previously (some of which are described below), but this was my first experience of building a complete product and I thoroughly enjoyed taking it from an idea all the way to market. Whilst the majority of my time was spent developing the game using Unity and C#, this project allowed me to employ and experience a wide range of skills, including designing game art, producing app previews and trailers, and beta testing through Apple's TestFlight.
            </p>
            <p>
                My other work includes my third year university project, <a href="http://rocketleagueanalytics.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Rocket League Analytics</a>, which provides in-game analytics, match history, and statistics tracking to Rocket League players, all with only an image of the match scoreboard.  This is the biggest web project I have undertaken and combines a frontend React app, including Redux and React Router, and backend Node.js server, which uses Google Cloud Vision API and Firebase Authentication amongst other technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                From my academic studies, I also have experience of programming in Java and Haskell.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, I hope to pursue other areas, such as mobile app development (away from gaming and Unity). I also have a keen interest in entrepreneurship and would like to find an opportunity to combine these skills and interests in the near future.
            </p>
